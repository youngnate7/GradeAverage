/***
 Consider a grading scheme where your final grade is computed more generously
 if your grades show improvement over the term.  Scores show improvement
 if each grade is greater than or equal to the previous grade.

 A student has x scores indexed from 0 to x-1.  If the scores have shown improvement
 only those grades with indexes greater than to equal to x/2 are averaged.  If the
 scores have not improved, all of the scores are averaged.
